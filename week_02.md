# Week 2 – Overview of CMSs
Name: Jiajun Jiang
Week: Week 2
## Learning Activities & Resources:
In the second week of the CP3402-Content Management System course, I learned the basics of how to use content 
management systems, static websites and dynamic websites. 

A content management system is an application that displays like a website. They allow multiple users to create, edit, 
manage, and publish the content of a website without basic coding techniques. Instead of using code to create HTML, 
CSS, JS, etc. The CMS can handle the basic website style for me, while I can focus more on the content of the website.

The static websites are made up of pre-built files like HTML, CSS, and JS that look the same to everyone and can only 
be modified by manually changing the code, one advantage of statistical websites is that they are cheap, fast, simple, 
and easy to build and maintain from scratch, their downside is a lack of scalability and personalization. Dynamic 
websites can display different information (time, place, Settings, etc.) to different visitors, dynamic websites are 
more expensive and complex to build than static ones, the user experience will be more personalized and allow users to
interact with more features. Working with a CMS to handle complex parts makes it easier to create, edit, manage, and 
publish websites. When a user requests a page, instead of storing the website in its own HTML, the server pulls 
information from a database and builds a custom HTML file for the user.

## Practical:
For my startup business, I want to change a new business, so I change my coffee shop website to a cybersecurity company
which is to offer the plan to protect user’s data and security. For this week’s practical, I also used Microsoft Azure 
to host my Joomla website, I explored the dashboard and got started on my website.

## Estimated Hours:
* Spend 6 hours on learning Joomla and how to host Joomla in Azure
* Spend 3 hours on edit my website

## Content Insights:
Learning what CMS is has given me a better understanding of what is going on this topic, and how I can create websites 
and add content to Joomla, changing the style. Knowing the difference between a static website and a dynamic website 
allows me to more clearly turn my website into a dynamic website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Exploring the Joomla dashboard was a long and tedious process, as I needed to understand each feature and try to change
it to see different results so that I could understand them better. This got me interested in content management 
systems, which might help me build a website for another company or myself in the future.

Exploring Azure dashboard is also tedious process, but once I understood each of azure's common features, I thought it 
would help me use Azure faster at work.
