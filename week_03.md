# Week 3 - WordPress: installation, settings, content, navigation, using themes and plugins
Name: Jiajun Jiang
Week: Week 3
## Learning Activities & Resources:
In the second week of CP3402 (Content management system), I explored and understood the basic functions of WordPress, 
including plugins and navigation. It is very similar to Joomla, but themes features are more perfect.

WordPress provides a user-friendly navigation interface that sits in a dashboard with Posts, Pages, Media, Appearance, 
Plugins, etc., which makes it easier for me to find and access. Posts are used for blogs, while pages are used for 
static content, such as "About Use" or "Contact" pages. Media allows you to upload, manage, and edit media files.

Themes are pre-designed templates that show the overall look and aesthetics of a website. I found that they also allow 
you to customize the look and feel you like, and they also include some paid themes.

Plugins provide more functionality for WordPress websites. They can add new features, enhance existing features, and 
integrate third-party services. I explored some of the available plugins in the WordPress repository, which includes 
both free and paid plans, and they also show how popular the plugins are.

## Practical:
I hosted my WordPress site on the Microsoft Azure, which is same with my Joomla site, at first, the way to host 
WordPress on Azure is different with host Joomla; to host Joomla, I need install Joomla manually, but WordPress don’t 
need but in general, everything is relatively smooth, I hosted my WordPress site with my startup business.
