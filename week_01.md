Week: week 1
## Learning Activities & Resources:
In the first week of the CP3402 (Content Management System), I concentrated on learning and understanding the basics 
of HTML and CSS again with LinkedIn learning and try to use Microsoft Azure to publish my website 
(my site ground account is overdue).

I use the study note and previous assignment in CP1406 (Web Development and Design) and the video on the LinkedIn 
learning as my resources to help me to recall the knowledge points about web design like the HTML is used for website 
content and CSS is for styling and formatting the website and would be best kept in separate files… and so on. The 
videos also help me to review some knowledge about the planning and prototyping, which is related to UX 
(learned in CP2408-Design Thinking).

In the practical guide resources, I noticed about we can publish the website with Microsoft Azure, Azure Blob allows 
users to publish and host their HTML, CSS, and JS files as a static sites, it's just what I need.

At first, I’m confused with how to publish my website on Azure, I try to check some information on Azure Learn and 
some videos about how to publish website on Azure in YouTube, which has helped me a lot of how to use Azure. Then I 
learned that Azure does not support publish entire folders containing HTML, CSS, and JS files. In Azure, all html 
files need to be uploaded separately for Azure to recognize correctly. When I publish all the files separately, the 
problem occurred again, this time the images and CSS in my files were not recognized by Azure, I realized that there 
were problems with the images and CSS paths in my HTML files, and then I tried to upload my CSS and images files as 
folders again, and this time the problem was successfully solved.
