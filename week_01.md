# Week 1 – Subject Intro & Web Design Basics
Name: Jiajun Jiang
Week: week 1
## Learning Activities & Resources:
In the first week of the CP3402 (Content Management System), I concentrated on learning and understanding the basics 
of HTML and CSS again with LinkedIn learning and try to use Microsoft Azure to publish my website 
(my site ground account is overdue).

I use the study note and previous assignment in CP1406 (Web Development and Design) and the video on the LinkedIn 
learning as my resources to help me to recall the knowledge points about web design like the HTML is used for website 
content and CSS is for styling and formatting the website and would be best kept in separate files… and so on. The 
videos also help me to review some knowledge about the planning and prototyping, which is related to UX 
(learned in CP2408-Design Thinking).

In the practical guide resources, I noticed about we can publish the website with Microsoft Azure, Azure Blob allows 
users to publish and host their HTML, CSS, and JS files as a static sites, it's just what I need.

At first, I’m confused with how to publish my website on Azure, I try to check some information on Azure Learn and 
some videos about how to publish website on Azure in YouTube, which has helped me a lot of how to use Azure. Then I 
learned that Azure does not support publish entire folders containing HTML, CSS, and JS files. In Azure, all html 
files need to be uploaded separately for Azure to recognize correctly. When I publish all the files separately, the 
problem occurred again, this time the images and CSS in my files were not recognized by Azure, I realized that there 
were problems with the images and CSS paths in my HTML files, and then I tried to upload my CSS and images files as 
folders again, and this time the problem was successfully solved.
## Practical:
For my startup business, I plan to make a website for a coffee shop called Camp Coffee, in the website, the customer 
can see what product we have and knows about our coffee menu, for the people whose are also interested in coffee, they 
can see the philosophy of our store, why we crate this coffee shop and our suggestions for different ways of making 
coffee. Also, all the customers can contact us by this website and know where we are.

## Content Insights:
Reviewing web design is a great help for me to learn about content management system, because web design is the 
foundation of CMS, and designing web pages according to user needs (UX) is a very important part of design, as well 
as CSS, layouts, colours, and other parts of the website, all play an important role in attracting potential users.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
The web design and development are mainly for understand user needs, design and crate websites, which can let me know 
how to publish a website, how to create website and how to beautify the style of the site. It may help me better 
complete the tasks at work in the future.
