Week: Week 4
## Learning Activities & Resources:
In the fourth week of CP3402, Content Management System, I explored and understood how to development and development
workflows in local host.

Localhost is a simulated server environment on your computer that allows you to develop, test, and debug websites or
Web applications locally, without having to modify the online server directly.

Using tools like XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, etc., you can run Apache + MySQL + PHP locally, completely simulating the real 
server environment.

It brings many advantages such as safer testing and development, faster speed, no network, easy debugging and suitable
for practice.
## Practical:
I use XAMPP to localhost, XAMPP is a free, open source, on-premises server environment for Windows, macOS and Linux.
It integrates Apache, MariaDB (MySQL), PHP, and Perl, allowing developers to build websites or Web applications 
locally without having to install each component separately. 

The deployment process is not difficult, on the contrary, it is a little easier than deploying a real server with Azure.

* [What is XAMPP](https://www.educba.com/what-is-xampp/)
## Estimated Hours:
Total for 5 hours spend on learn how to localhost.
## Content Insights:
Exploring the XAMPP let me know a new way to host the website and what the different between the localhost and sever 
host, use localhost deployment my website can let the speed of development faster than before.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Learning about the localhost gave me an experience which can let me development my website in a faster and much safer 
place. This experience may let me do well in my future work.
